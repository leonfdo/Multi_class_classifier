# Multi_Class_Classifier

In this project, I used an SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer with a cross-entropy classifier to perform multi-class classification. The dataset consists of four different types of synthetic data produced by the scikit-learn make_blobs method. The classifier model seeks to reduce the difference between predicted and actual class probabilities by using the cross-entropy loss function and SGD optimizer. The code showcases the key steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This example serves as a starting point for understanding multi-class classification using synthetic data and can be further extended for exploring various machine learning algorithms and techniques.
